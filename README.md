CollisionDemo
=============

A project I built for an independent study demonstrating basic 2D collision using openFrameworks.

If you plan to build the project, there are a few steps that will expedite the process:

1. Download the openFrameworks library for Visual Studio 2012 at http://openframeworks.cc/download
2. Place the CollisionDemo folder in the myApps folder found from root->apps->myApps
3. Open the .sln and build the project, if any errors occur make sure the build tools are set to the appropriate version (v110 for 2012)
Project should be viewable after that! Use the sliders to change colors, number of particles, and reset the demo. Resize the window for extra fun!
